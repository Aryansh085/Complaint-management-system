For those who are not aware of how to solve this error using Windows PowerShell

Open PowerShell (Run As Administrator)
Check the current execution policy using this command
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    # You should get 'Restricted'
Run this command to make it 'Unrestricted'
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Check again whether execution policy changed by running this command
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    # You should get 'Unrestricted'
Now try to run nodemon on your project
    nodemon 'filename.js'
Hope this would be helpful
